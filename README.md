### Wireshark profiles

A great way to get the most out of Wireshark is to create Configuration Profiles.  These profiles allow you to save configuration settings and filters based on protocol or application.  By customizing the columns, colorization rules, and filters for a protocol, you can quickly get down to those packets that are part of the problem.


### Configuring profiles

For more details on Wireshark profiles and how to configure and apply them to your locally installed Wireshark instance, please visit the following:

### Custom profiles

Below are the set of profiles that can be used to aid to protocol analysis using Wireshark. However on top of that, I've made few custom changes based on my personal preferences.

**NOTE:** *I am not a huge fan of Packet diagrams, thus I've turned them off in my custom settings on top of these profiles. You can consider these set of profiles I've shared are done on top of these above author's default provided profiles.*
